# RiyadhSouq App
RiyadhSouq is a test app during Kodeco bootcamp for iOS, built using SwiftUI. It offers users the ability to browse and purchase a wide range of products, manage their shopping cart, and utilize promotional codes to obtain discounts. The app's responsive design ensures a seamless shopping experience, enhancing user engagement through a well-organized product display and efficient navigation.


## Features

- Product Browsing: View a list of products, complete with detailed descriptions and images.
- Detailed Product Views: Each product can be clicked on to reveal further details and additional images, which users can swipe through.
- Shopping Cart Management: Users can add items to their cart, remove them, or adjust quantities. The cart view also supports promotional codes for discounts.
- Automatic Promotions: Apply promotional codes directly within the shopping cart to receive immediate discounts.
- Persistent Data: The app caches product data locally to reduce load times and improve the user experience during subsequent visits.

Adding Products to Cart
